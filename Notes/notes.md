### UnderStanding Call hierarchy

A call hierarchy is a tree-like structure that shows all the calls from and to a function or method. It's a useful tool for understanding and navigating code, as it allows you to see where a function is called and what other functions it calls.

**Outgoing Calls**

Outgoing calls in a call hierarchy refer to the calls that a function or method makes. In other words, these are the functions or methods that are called by the function you're examining. For example, if you have a function `A` that calls function `B`, then `B` is an outgoing call from `A`.

**Incoming Calls**

Incoming calls in a call hierarchy refer to the calls made to a function or method. These are the functions or methods that call the function you're examining. For example, if you have a function `A` that is called by function `B`, then `B` is an incoming call to `A`.
